								Group Discussion is a very important round in any selection process, be it for an MBA course, campus recruitment or for any graduate/post graduate degree. The selection committee conducts GD to gauge whether the candidate has certain personality traits and/or skills that it desires in its members</p>

								<ul class="body_text">
									<li>Ability to work in a team</li>
									<li>Communication skills</li>
									<li>Leadership skills</li>
									<li>Reasoning ability</li>
									<li>Initiativeness</li>
									<li>Assertiveness</li>
									<li>Creatibility</li>
									<li>Flexibility</li>
									<li>Ability to think and act independently</li>
								 </ul>

							<p class="body_text" align="justify">Normally groups of 8-10 candidates are formed into a leaderless group, and are given a specific 
							situation to analyse and discuss within a given time limit. The group may be given a Case Study and 
							asked to come out with a solution for a problem. The group may be given a topic and asked to 
							discuss on the same. A panel will observe the proceedings and evaluate the members of the group.</p>

							<p class="body_text" align="justify">Well, a very important factor that you must keep an eye on is 
							your confidence. When ever you are in a face to face group discussion be confident, understand the 
							topic and then put on your views. At times, we jump into a discussion without bothering much about 
							the subject matter, that is where we go wrong!</p>

							<p class="body_text" align="justify">In order to face a group discussion and make a stand at it, you 
							must do the following things:</p>

								<ul class="body_text">
									<li>Have a basic knowledge about your area of interest.</li>
									<li>Prepare well about the possible questionnaires.</li>
									<li>Do a little bit research on the subject matter before going on to a discussion.</li>
									<li>Be clear in your thoughts and communicate your point well.</li>
									<li>Avoid being harsh or imposing your point on some one. You may keep your point in front of others by giving it subsequent evidence but, can not tell others to believe it.</li>
									<li>Be strong in your voice yet polite in your execution of words.</li>
								</ul>
								
							<p class="body_text" align="justify">If you keep these few tips in mind, you surely will crack the 
							face to face group discussion in a more apt way. Also, once you appear in a G.D you might feel a 
							bit nervous. But, do not let that stress you out, relax, take a deep breathe, feel confident and 
							take it on! If you believe in yourself and have a basic knowledge of the topic, you can easily 
							bring out your view point in front of every one else. Even if you get a topic that you are not 
							familiar with, try and think about it, make out the possible points of discussion and go on! In 
							either case, what ever you speak should be valid and make sure to speak out in full poise.</p>

							<p class="body_text" align="justify">I hope above mention tips will help you to face a group 
							discussion. Go ahead and stand out among others!</p>
