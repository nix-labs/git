							<p class="body_text" align="justify"><b>Ten rules for an interview</b></p>
							
							<ol class="body_text">
								<li>Keep your answers brief and concise. Unless asked to give more details, limit your answers to two to three minutes per question. To practice you can tape yourself and see how long it takes you to fully answer a question.</li>
								<li>Include concrete, quantifiable data. Interviewees tend to talk in generalities. Unfortunately, generalities often fail to convince interviewers that the applicant has assets. Include measurable information and provide details about specific accomplishments when discussing your strengths.</li>
								<li>Repeat your key strengths three times. It's essential that you comfortably and confidently articulate your strengths. Explain how the strengths relate to the company's or department's goals and how they might benefit the potential employer. If you repeat your strengths then they will be remembered and-if supported with quantifiable accomplishments-they will more likely be believed.</li>
								<li>Prepare five or more success stories. In preparing for interviews, make a list of your skills and key assets. Then reflect on past jobs and pick out one or two instances when you used those skills successfully.</li>
								<li>Put yourself on their team. Ally yourself with the prospective employer by using the employer's name and products or services. For example, "As a member of __________, I would carefully analyze the __________ and ______." Show that you are thinking like a member of the team and will fit in with the existing environment. Be careful though not to say anything that would offend or be taken negatively. Your research will help you in this area.</li>
								<li>Image is often as important as content. What you look like and how you say something are just as important as what you say. Studies have shown that 65 percent of the conveyed message is nonverbal; gestures, physical appearance, and attire are highly influential during job interviews.</li>
								<li>Ask questions. The types of questions you ask and the way you ask them can make a tremendous impression on the interviewer. Good questions require advance preparation. Just as you plan how you would answer an interviewer's questions, write out any specific questions you want to ask. Then look for opportunities to ask them during the interview. Don't ask about benefits or salary. The interview process is a two-way street whereby you and the interviewer assess each other to determine if there is an appropriate match.</li>
								<li>Maintain a conversational flow. By consciously maintaining a conversational flow-a dialogue instead of a monologue-you will be perceived more positively. Use feedback questions at the end of your answers and use body language and voice intonation to create a conversational interchange between you and the interviewer.</li>
								<li>Research the company, product lines and competitors. Research will provide information to help you decide whether you're interested in the company and important data to refer to during the interview.</li>
								<li>Keep an interview journal. As soon as possible, write a brief summary of what happened. Note any follow-up action you should take and put it in your calendar. Review your presentation. Keep a journal of your attitude and the way you answered the questions. Did you ask questions to get the information you needed? What might you do differently next time? Prepare and send a brief, concise thank you letter. Restate your skills and stress what you can do for the company.</li>
							</ol>
							
							<p class="body_text" align="justify"><b>Sample Questions</b></p>
							
							<ol class="body_text">
								<li>Why did you apply for this position?</li>
								<li>Would you tell us what attracts you to a career with us? How do you see your studies, skills, experience and personal qualities contributing to the work of the organisation?</li>
								<li>Describe a time when you had to deal with conflicting demands. How did you deal with this situation and what was the outcome?</li>
								<li>Can you describe a time where you have been required to perform as part of a team? What was the situation? What part did you play in the team and what was the outcome of the exercise?</li>
								<li>How do you establish a working relationship with new people?</li>
								<li>Where do you expect to be in 5 years time? What will you do if you are not successful in gaining this position?</li>
								<li>What particular skills and qualities do you bring to the workforce? What other skills would you like to develop in the future?</li>
								<li>Tell me about a challenging situation you have faced. What was the situation and how did you cope with it?</li>
								<li>Is there an achievement of which you are particularly proud? What is it? Why is it significant?</li>
								<li>What computer programs are you familiar with, and more specifically, what programs would you use to write a report, enter research data, and to prepare a poster or seminar.</li>

							<p class="body_text"><b>Phone Interview</b></p>
							
							<p class="body_text">The best way for a company to make the best out of time and costs is by interviewing candidates on the phone, especially when candidates live out of town or abroad. It is true that a recruiter cannot find the best candidate on the phone but this method definitely narrows the options, and only the selected candidates are invited to a one-on-one interview. Telephone interviews rarely last more than 30 minutes.</p>
							<p class="body_text">Another reasons to go for a job interview is to get a better idea of the candidate´s personality and to test him/her if the job has to do with talking to people.</p>
							<p class="body_text">Sometimes telephone interviews are scheduled ahead of time; sometimes recruiters call candidates and ask them if they have a few minutes to talk.</p>
							<p class="body_text">There are many things you can check while having this type of interview: how properly the candidate speaks, how enthusiastic he/she sounds, how polite he/she is, how many questions of his/her own the candidate asks, if the candidate forgot the appointment.</p>
							
							<p class="body_text" align="justify"><b>Tips for Interviewers:</b></p>
							
							<ol class="body_text">
								<li>Keep the CV and all necessary information about the candidate you are calling at hand when calling.</li>
								<li>Have a pen and paper within reach.</li>
								<li>Make sure your call-waiting mode is off so the interview is not interrupted.</li>
								<li>In case your call has not been scheduled and the candidate is not available make sure to re-schedule the appointment at a convenient time.</li>
								<li>Make a list of important questions you would like to ask.</li>
								<li>Make sure there will not be noises or interruptions.</li>
								<li>Remember that a landline is always more reliable than a mobile phone line.</li>
								<li>Make straight, clear questions; you do not want to repeat yourself many times on the phone.</li>
								<li>Keep water near you to wet your throat.</li>
								<li>Keep an appropriate voice tone.</li>
								<li>Check the candidate´s info clearly before calling.</li> 
								<li>Take notes of everything you consider important right after you hang up.</li>
