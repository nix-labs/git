								<b>Q: Why should I meet with a career counselor?</b>
								<br /><br />
								A: Career counselors can be helpful for people at any stage of their academic or professional 
								career. As a student at Hamline, you should think about meeting with a career counselor 
								if you're not sure about what you want to major in, or what career you are interested 
								in pursuing. Career counselors can help you think about how your values, skills and 
								interests might fit into the world of work, and help you find the information you need to make 
								a decision that is right for you.<br />
								Career counselors can also help you achieve your goals by assisting you with the internship 
								and job search process. They can help you develop your resume, cover letter and 
								interviewing skills. You can meet with a counselor to talk about internship and job search 
								strategies, and how to best present yourself to potential employers.<br />
								In short, counselors are available to help you for any sorts of questions or concerns you 
								might have about your academic or career goals. Even if you're not sure about what those 
								goals might be, a career counselor is here to help!

								<b>Q: Will the career counselor find me a career or job?</b>
								<br /><br />
								A: Although it would be great if career counselors could hand you a prescription for the perfect 
								career, you are the only real expert on what is right for you.  What career counselors can do is 
								help you sort out the issues of what you would like in a job, and what jobs might meet that 
								description.  They can also help you find ways to get more information about the world of work 
								so you can be sure your decision is the right one.<br />
								Similarly, career counselors can't give you an internship opportunity or a job offer once you 
								graduate.  They can, however, teach you the skills you need to know in order to find these 
								opportunities on your own.  Having these skills is important for you long-term because it gives 
								you the power to tackle any job search you undertake in the future.  Of course, it never hurts 
								to check-in with a counselor to refresh your skills now and then!

								<b>Q: What should I do to prepare for my appointment?</b>
								<br /><br />
								A: There's not a whole lot you need to do to get ready for your first career counseling 
								appointment.  Just think about what questions you have or what information you need to know.  
								Feel free to bring any materials you have as well - counselors are always happy to look over 
								a resume or cover letter, or help you dissect a job or internship posting for the key skills 
								the employer may want in their candidates.<br />
								After you meet with a career counselor for the first appointment, you may set some goals to 
								achieve before meeting with him or her again.  You and your counselor will decide upon these 
								goals together, and develop a timeline that works for your schedule.

								<b>Q: Will you help me with my academic questions?</b>
								<br /><br />
								A: Career counselors can help you with questions about choosing a major, or selecting classes 
								that might help you gain skills or experiences for your career.  For questions about academic 
								or major requirements, your best resource is your academic advisor, or Academic Services.

								<a target="_self" name="q_5" class=""></a>
								<b>Q: Why are you called career "counselors?" Will I have to talk about my "feelings?"</b>
								<br /><br />
								A: Career counselors are trained counselors with M.A.s or Ph.D.s, but they won't ask you to 
								share information about your personal life.  Although career issues and personal issues often 
								influence one another, career counselors usually do not delve too deep into the area of your 
								mental health.  If they sense that some very personal or emotional issues are influencing your 
								ability to tackle your career concerns, however, they might suggest you meet with a counselor 
								in Counseling and Health Services.  Many students who are dealing with issues such as 
								depression, loss or transition find that meeting with a personal counselor to sort through 
								some of these life difficulties makes them better able to work with a career counselor on 
								their career issues.  However, career counselors will NEVER force you to see a personal 
								counselor.  That decision is entirely up to you.
